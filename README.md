# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I was motivated to build a space where keynotes from my prework could be kept for easy access.
- I built this space to be a quick referance resource for all the information I learned in my prework. This includes conceptual information as well as terminal commands.
- This webpage solves the problem of having to spend unnecesary tine searching for answers to problems that will come up often.
- I learned about coding at a profesional level within the scope of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git. I also learned about how to profesionally log all the steps of the coding process and how to make a README.md file.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
